## Overview

This is a desktop and mobile version website that offers information about living a healthy lifestyle. It features includes: Nutrition, Fitness, Clean-air and Mental health.

### The challenge

- Develop a website in a team environment. Use a Content Management System (CMS), to keep track of all activity and assigned work.

### Designs

Due to time constraints, UX/UI designs were not created, but instead was implemented as the website was being built. Big thanks to [Oxana](https://oxana-howard.com/) for initiating the designs.

### What we learned

**Johnson Thieu:**
This was a great opportunity for me to share my knowledge with Github as our Content Management System. Helping my team learn how to manage their branches and merging into our development branch was no easy task. Sitting with them in the hot seat during merge conflicts and explain why they occurred, solidified my experience.

I furthered my knowledge by using platforms such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), to store data for API calls. I learned how to use and add data from the API and render the information in a dropdown and using props to render the content.

**Mike Villa:**
This project was a great learning experience for me. Working in a team of three developers I was able to experience using git from a whole new point of view. I was also able to see how different the process of building a website is with multiple developers working on different parts of the project concurrently. For me one of the most valuable experiences was working through the code written by my teammates to help solve problems and to build new features into that code. In addition to all of this I was able to further my experience with using API's and Redux by implementing them into the project.

**Oxana Howard:**
This project was a great opportunity ro work in a team and create the balance when I needed to push my ideas and listen to others' opinion. My goal was to create an app from scratch to deployment that works well and looks good on different devises. It was important to me to find the balance in which stretching goals are set up and achieved, but not affected the deadlines. I was able to deep dive into following topics and technologies: express js, API data fetching and css. Additionally I started learning how github  works in team projects.
